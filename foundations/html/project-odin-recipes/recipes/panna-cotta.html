    <h2>Delicious Panna Cotta Recipe</h2>
    <p>Panna cotta is a traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. I had a difficult time finding a good, simple recipe
    so I made up my own. It tastes just like the panna cotta served at Italian restaurants!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup skim milk</li>
      <li>1 (0.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until combined. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a boil; watch carefully as the
      cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.</li>
      <li>Immediately stir gelatin mixture into boiling cream, stirring until completely dissolved. Cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in vanilla.</li>
      <li>Pour cream mixture into 6 individual ramekins. Leave to cool, uncovered, until no longer warm, about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>When cool, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.</li>
    </ol>
